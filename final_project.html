        <p>Here is my proposal for my final project! I decided to make a birdhouse that lights up around the outside of the house when the bird goes inside of the house. It also has a lid that covers the 
          food tray which opens when the bird sits next to the food tray. I wanted the birdhouse to light up so that the owner of the birdhouse would know when there was a bird using it and could go look at the
          bird. I incorporated the food lid so that the bird food wouldnt be exposed at all times but only when a bird was trying to eat.

      <div class="schematic">
        <p>Here are my drawings of the schematic for this circuit. I connected the capacitive sensor around the food tray to pins 2 and 4. I connected the capacitive sensor inside the bird house 
          to pins 5 and 7. I used 1M ohm resistors to connect the capacitive sensors to the arduino in order to make the sensors require absolute touch to turn on the LEDs and open the food lid. 
          I used the LED strip which I connected to an external power supply (12V) and to a N-MOSFET transistor which I connected to pin 11 and the ground on my Arduino. I also used a servo motor 
          which I connected to pin 10, the 5V pin, and the ground. </p>

      <div class="circuit">
        <p>Here is my circuit I made. I chose to use a servo motor and the LED strip. I also used two capacitive sensors. I connected the capacitive sensor 
          around the food tray to pins 2 and 4. I connected the capacitive sensor inside the bird house to pins 5 and 7. I used 1M ohm resistors to connect 
          the capacitive sensors to the Arduino so that the birds will have to touch the metal pieces in order to turn on the LEDs and open the food lid. 
          I connected the servo motor to pin 10 as well as the 5V pin, and the ground. I connected the LED strip to the external power supply and the transistor 
          which was connected to pin 11 on my Arduino. Based on the specfications for the LED strip and the resistors that are included in the LED strip, it says 
          that if using a 12V power source it will result in 1.5 A of current. According to the datasheet for the transistor I am using, it has a maximum current of 37.2 A so the amount of 
          current that I am using is less than the maximum and is safe to use.

      <div class="circuit">
        <p>Here is the birdhouse that I made. I cut out pieces of metal for my capacitive sensors and attatched one around the edges of the food tray and another smaller one on the floor, inside of the birdhouse. I connected both of these pieces 
          to the breadboard and my arduino using the aligator clip cables. I drilled a hole in the back of the birdhouse so that the cable connecting the capacitive sesnor inside the house could go through the back of 
          the house and not be seen from the front. I also cut out a a thin, lightweight piece of metal to use as the food lid and attached it to the servo motor. I then attched the servo motor to the outside of the birdhouse, so that the lid 
          was covering the food tray, and connected the motor to my arduino. I trimed and attatched the LED strip around the outide of the birdhouse roof and connected it to the 12V power source, and to the arduino through a transistor. Once the rest 
          of my circuit was assembled, I enclosed all of the wiring, breadboard, and arduino within a cardboard box so that the circuit can not be seen and the birds/elements can't access it. The cardboard box can be opened from the back if it needs to be so that
          I can access the circuit. The box also has small cut outs in it so that the aligator clips to the capacitive sensors, wires from the servo motor, and cords from the 12V power source and arduino can exit the box to be plugged in.

      <div class="code">
        <p>Here is a code snipit from the Arduino code that I wrote for the circuit. I used the Capacitive Sensor and Servo libraries. I connected my LEDs through my transistor to pin 11 and my servo motor to pin 10. I connected the 
          capacitive sensor for the servo motor to pins 2 and 4. I connected the capacitive sensor for the LEDs to pins 5 and 7. I set the pin mode of pin 11 to output which allows the PMW signal to control the gate of the transistor, 
          allowing for the arduino to control a higher voltage than it could on its own.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose to use the smoothing method for every 10 readings for each sensor because I was getting inconsistent readings when testing which was leading to flickering in my LEDs and excess movement in my servo motor that I didnt want. 
          Due to the inconsistent readings when testing I chose to calibrate each sensor in the setup of program for 5 seconds each. In the first five seconds the servo motor sensor is calibrated and in the next five seconds the LED sensor is 
          calibrated. During testing I noticed that the LEDs and servo motor were struggling to reach fully on and fully off so I decided to reduce the sensor windows for each sensor by adding 100 to each minimum value found and subtract 100 
          from each maximum value found. I constrained the average reading values from each sensor to the calibrated max and min values found in the set up. I mapped the LED strip PMW number from 0 to 255 to allow the LEDs to turn all the way on and off. 
          A higher PMW number results in a higher duty cycle and brighter LEDs, while a lower PMW number results in a lower duty cycle and dimmer LEDs. I mapped the servo motor degrees from 0 to 50 to make sure the food lid can close compeletely 
          and doesn't run into the house when fully opened.
          
          My code delays each reading by 100ms to give the servo motor time to rotate and the LED lights time to turn on.
