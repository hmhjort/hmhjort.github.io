      <p>Here are my drawings of the schematic for this circuit. I used a servo motor which I connected to pin 9, the 5V pin, and the ground. 
        I also used the capacitive sensor which I connected to pins 2 and 4. I used a 1M ohm resistor in order to make the sensor require 
        absolute touch in order to turn on the servo motor.

      <p>Here is my circuit I made. I chose to use a servo motor and a capacitive sensor. I connected the servo motor to pin 9 as well as the 5V pin, 
        and the ground. I connected the capacitive sensor to pins 2 and 4 and used a 1M ohm resistor so that you would have to touch the metal object
        (coin) in order to turn on the motor.

    <div class="code">
      <p> Here is the code snipit from the Arduino code that I wrote for the circuit. I used the Capacitive Sensor and Servo 
        libraries. I connected my servo motor to pin 9 and my capacitive sensor to pins 2 and 4. I mapped the servo motor degrees from
        0 to 180 to relation to the sensor values between 0 and 1000. I chose the degrees for the servo motor based on how many degrees 
        it is able to turn. I chose the sensor values based on the values that I was receiving in my serial monitor when testing the capacitive sensor to make sure that it was able to 
        reach the full 180 degrees when being touched. My code delays each reading by 100ms to give the servo motor time to rotate before recieving the next reading.

      <pre><code>
        #include <CapacitiveSensor.h>  // Use capacitive sensor library
        #include <Servo.h>    // Use capacitive servo library
            
        CapacitiveSensor   cs_4_2 = CapacitiveSensor(4,2);      // create a capacitive sensor object between pins 2 and 4 
        Servo myServo;  // create a servo object
            
        void setup() {
            cs_4_2.set_CS_AutocaL_Millis(0xFFFFFFFF);  // turn off autocalibrate on arduino
            Serial.begin(9600);  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps
            myServo.attach(9); // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
        }
            
        void loop() {
            long start = millis();  // record number of milliseconds that have passed 
            long total1 =  cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30); // record value returned from capaicitve sensor
            total2 = map(total1, 0, 1000, 0, 180);  // map capacitive sensor values to servo motor degress of turning
            myServo.write(total2);    // rotate servo motor 
            
            Serial.print(millis() - start);     // check on performance in milliseconds
            Serial.print("\t");                 // tab character for debug window spacing
            
            Serial.println(total2);             // print sensor output 
            delay(100);                         // delay 100ms to limit data to serial port

    <div class="questions">
      <p>1. Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.
      </p>
      <img src="Graph_A4.png" />
      <p>2.  I would average out the values that are being read in the loop and change the output based on that value.
        <pre><code>
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            total += sensor reading;
            delay(5);
        }
        total = map(total, sensor values, ouput values);
        output.write(total);
     </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>3.  To address this I would use the constrain method to make sure that the values arent outside of the normal range.  I would also keep track of the last input value and only change the 
      output value if the input value hasnt jumped too far from the last input value. 
        <pre><code>
      int lastReading = 0;
      long newReading = sensor reading;
      int conReading = constrain(newReading, low sensor value, high sensor value);

      if (difference between lastReading and conReading < 5% of max sensor value) {
        lastReading = conReading
        conReading = map(sensor values, output values)
        output.write(conReading)
      }
    </code></pre>
