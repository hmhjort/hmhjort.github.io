      <p>Here are my drawings of the schematic for this circuit. I used the LED strip which I connected to an external power supply (12V) and to a N-MOSFET transistor
        which I connected to pin 9 and the ground on my Arduino. I also used the capacitive sensor which I connected to pins 2 and 4. I used a 1M ohm resistor in 
        order to make the sensor require absolute touch in order to turn on the LEDs.

    <div class="circuit">
      <p>Here is my circuit I made. I chose to use a capacitive sensor and the LED strip along with the N-MOSFET transistor and external 
        power supply. I connected the capacitive sensor to pins 2 and 4 and used a 1M ohm resistor so that you would have to touch the metal object
        (coin) in order to turn on the LEDs. I connected the LED strip to the extenranl power supply and the transistor which was connected to pin 9 
        on my Arduino. Based on the specfications for the LED strip and the resistors that are included in the LED strip, it says that if using a 12V power source
        it will result in 1.5 A of current. According to the datasheet for the transistor I am using, it has a maximum current of 37.2 A so the amount of 
        current that I am using is less than the maximum and is safe to use.

    <div class="code">
      <p> Here is the code snipit from the Arduino code that I wrote for the circuit. I used the Capacitive Sensor library. I connected my LEDs through my trsnsistor to pin 9 and my capacitive sensor to pins 2 and 4. I set 
        the pin mode of pin 9 to output which allows the PMW signal to control the gate of the transistor, allowing for the adruino to control a higher voltage than it could on its own. A higher PMW number results higher
        duty cycle and brighter LEDs, while a lower PMW number results in a lower duty cyclde and dimmer LEDs.  
        I mapped the LED strip PMW number from 0 to 255 in relation to the sensor values between 200 and 1000. I chose the sensor values based on the values that I was receiving in my serial monitor when testing the 
        capacitive sensor to make sure that the LEDs were able to reach full brightness when the coin was touched. I chose to use the smoothing method for every 10 readings because I was getting inconsistent readings 
        when testing which was leading to flickering in my LEDs that I didnt want. I also chose to contrain the average reading value because sometimes during testing I was receiving variable readings from the sensor when I wasnt
        touching the coin and I wanted the LEDs to be completely off when the coin wasnt being touched. My code delays each reading by 50ms to reduce output in the serial monitor and allow the LEDs time to adjust.
