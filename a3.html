    <div class="schematic">
      <p>Here are my drawings of the schematic for this circuit. I used a red LED which was connected to pin 10 and a 220 ohm 
        resistor and a green LED which was connected to pin 9 and a 200ohm resistor. I also used a Joystick which was connected to both the analog input A0 pin for the x values, and the analog input A1 
        pin for the y values.

    <div class="calculation">
      <p>Here is my calculation for the resistor for this circuit. </p>
      <p> The Arduino output voltage is 5V and both the red and green LEDs have a voltage drop of 1.8V. The desired current for 
        the LED is 20mA or .02A. Based on my calculation of a 160 ohms I used a 220 ohm resistor to ensure 
        that the current in each LED wouldn't exceed 20mA. The joystick has 2 potentiometers inside of it which 
        form the voltage divider so I didnt need to add another external resistor on the circuit board. The joystick
        voltage divider should have between 5V and 0V depending on the position and the resistance. The resting middle position
        should result in 2.5V.

    <div class="circuit">
      <p>Here is my circuit I made. I chose to use a red LED, green LED and the joystick as my sensor. I connected the LED to pin 9 and the 
        joystick to pin 2 on my Arduino. The x values are of my joystick that control the green LED are connected and read through the A0 analog input pin, and the 
        y values that control the red LED are being read through the A1 analog input pin.

    <div class="code">
      <p> Here is the code snipit from the Arduino code that I wrote for the circuit. I used a green LED and connected it 
        to the 9 pin on my Arduino.I used a red LED and connected it to the 10 pin on my Arduino. I also used a joystick as 
        my sensor and connected it to the 2 pin on my Arduino. The x input values from the joystick are connected to the A0 analog input pin 
        and control the green LED, and the y values are connected to the A1 analog input pin and control the red LED. 
        I chose to have the maximum input value (1023) for x and y values correspond to the brightest output value for the LED (255). 
        I also chose to have any input value lower than 50 correspond to a 0 output value, turning the LED completely off.

    <div class="questions">
      <p>1. In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? 
        Justify your answer with example calculations.
        In my voltage divider, the variable resistor can not be either R1 or R2. It must be R2 so that with the most minimal resistance (0), the 
        out voltage is 0 and the LED wont be on, and with increased resistance the voltage increases. These calculations show how the 
        voltage changes with respect to the varying resistence depending on if the variable resistor is R1 or R2. 
        The first photo shows how if the variable resistor is R1, then with increased resistance, there is a decrease in voltage. 
        The second photo shows how if the variable resistor is R2, then with increased resistance, the voltage increases.

      <p>2.  Here is my voltage graph showing the voltage over time of my voltage divider throughout the time in the gif. The voltage divider moves between 5V and 0V
        depending on the position of the joystick and the varying resistance. The middle resting postion of the joystick results in 2.5V from the divider.

      <p>3.  My map code would have to change to be: map(input, 0, 65535, 0, 1023). The new 10-bit PWM would allow it to handle output values from 0 to 1023, and the 
        16-bit analog-to-digital converter would allow it to handle input values from 0 to 65535. The new map() function would need to accomodate these new values 
        and connect the appropriate input values to their output values. </p>
