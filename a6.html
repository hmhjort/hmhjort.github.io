    <div class="schematic">
      <p>Here are my drawings of the schematic for this circuit.  I used a red LED which was connected to pin 9 and a 220 ohm 
        resistor. I also used a Joystick which was connected to both the analog input A0 pin for the x values, and the analog input A1 
        pin for the y values.

    <div class="calculation">
      <p>Here is my calculation for the resistor for this circuit. </p>
      <p> The Arduino output voltage is 5V and the red LED has a voltage drop of 1.8V. The desired current for 
        the LED is 20mA or .02A. Based on my calculation of a 160 ohms I used a 220 ohm resistor to ensure 
        that the current in the LED wouldn't exceed 20mA. The joystick has 2 potentiometers inside of it which 
        form the voltage divider so I didnt need to add another external resistor on the circuit board. The joystick
        voltage divider should have between 5V and 0V depending on the position and the resistance. The resting middle position
        should result in 2.5V.

    <div class="circuit">
      <p>Here is my circuit I made. I chose to use a red LED as my output and the joystick as the two inputs. I connected the LED to pin 9 and the 
        joystick to pin 2 on my Arduino. The x values are of my joystick are connected and read through the A0 analog input pin, and the 
        y values are being read through the A1 analog input pin.

    <div class="code">
      <p> Here is the code snipit from the Arduino code that I wrote for the circuit. I connected the red led to pin 9 on the Arduino.
        The x values from the joystick are being read through analog pin A0, and the y values from the joystick are being read through 
        analog pin A1. The led is initially set to off and then is turned on and off based readings from the serial port. The x and y values
        from the joystick read through the analog pins have values between 0 and 1023 because the Arduino is a 10-bit converter and can therfore 
        read 1024 different voltage values that the joystick generates. These values are printed to the serial port.

      <pre><code>
        // Creating constants for pins.
        const int red = 9;  // pin that the LED is attached to
        const int x = A0;    // Analog input pin for the x value
        const int y = A1;    // Analog input pin for the y value

        // Creating variables for reading and outputting x and y values
        int xval = 0;     // Variable for reading x values 
        int yval = 0;     // Variable for reading y values

        void setup() {
        // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
          Serial.begin(9600);

          pinMode(red, OUTPUT);   // set led pin to output 
          digitalWrite(red, LOW);   // turn led off

            String ledInstruction = Serial.readStringUntil("\n");   // reads first line of serial port
            ledInstruction.trim();   // trims excess whitespace

        <p> Here is the code that I wrote for the p5.js to control the p5 page. The draw function reads in x and y values 
          from the serial port. These values are between 0 and 1023 which corresponds to the position of the joystick. These values are 
          mapped to values between 50 and 500 which correspond to postions on the webpage to allow the 100x100 circle to move around the 
          webpage without going outside the edges of the view. The key pressed and key released functions determine if the space bar 
          has been pressed and then sends messsages to the serial port to turn the led on or off.
