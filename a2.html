      <p>Here is my calculation for the resistors for this circuit. </p>
      <p> The Arduino output voltage is 5V and each LED has a voltage drop of 1.8V. The desired current for 
        each LED is 20mA or .02A. Based on my calculation of a 160 ohms I used a 220 ohm resistor to ensure 
        that the current in each LED wouldn't exceed 20mA. For my pushbutton resistor I used a 10k ohm 
        resistor to enure that there is a stable voltage level for the circuit and that the pushbutton doesn't 
        unpredicatbly move between open and closed.

      <p>Here is my circuit I made. I chose to use 3 LEDs including a red, yellow, and green LED. 
        I connected these LEDs to the 5, 6, and 9 pins in my Arduino. I also used a pushbutton which is connected 
        to the 10 pin in my Arduino.

    <div class="code">
      <p>Here is a code snipit from the Arduino code that I wrote for the circuit. I used red, yellow, and green LEDs and 
        connected them to the 5, 6, and 9 pins in my Arduino. I also used a pushbutton which I connected to the 10 pin on 
        my Arduino. I chose to have both the yellow and green LEDs each light up for 1000ms and then turn off for 1000ms. I chose 
        to have the red LED slowly fade from 0 to 255 PWM pausing for 9ms between each inscrease in PWM. Then there is a 1000ms pause before
        the loop starts again.  </p>

        // Label LED pins and button pin
        int red = 9; // Pin for red LED

        int buttonPin = 10; // Pin for button

          // Set all LED pins as OUTPUT
          pinMode(yellow, OUTPUT);  // initialize yellow LED as an output.
          pinMode(green, OUTPUT);   // initialize green LED as an output.
          pinMode(red, OUTPUT);   // initialize red LED as an output.

          pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input.
        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          // turn red LED on and off 
          digitalWrite(yellow, HIGH);  // turn the yellow LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
          delay(1000);                      // wait for 1000 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(yellow, LOW);   // turn the yellow LED off by making the voltage LOW

      <p>1. Voltage Graph </p>

      <p>2.  Based on my circuit, schematic, and firmware my circuit could run for about 190.15 hours if being powered by a 
        1200mA battery. Both my yellow and green LEDs have 14.5mA of current when turned on for 1000ms each and my red LED has between 0 and 
        14.5mA of current as it fades on during the 2295ms it takes to fully turn on. During this loop, there are 1000ms breaks between LEDs turning on. 
        Based on the fact that current does not flow if the LEDs are not turned on, my circuit could run for approximately 190.15 hours before the 
        battery would run out.
